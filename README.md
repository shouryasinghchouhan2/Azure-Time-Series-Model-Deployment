# Azure-Time-Series-Model-Deployment

# Business Objective

Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is based on DevOps principles and practices
that increase the efficiency of workflows. For example, continuous integration,
delivery, and deployment. MLOps enables the automated management of the end-to-
end machine learning lifecycle. The main goal of MLOps is the faster deployment of
models in production.
We will be using Azure as our cloud platform. Microsoft Azure provides many robust
services in its ecosystem to create an end-to-end MLOps pipeline. In this project, we
will be deploying our time-series deep learning model on the Azure cloud platform in a
multi-part format.

# Aim

To create an MLOps project using the Microsoft Azure platform to deploy a deep
learning model in production.

# Tech stack

 Language - Python
 Libraries - Flask, pickle, pandas
 Services - Flask, Azure
